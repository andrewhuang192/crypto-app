[Click here to start!](https://full-stack-crypto-tracker.herokuapp.com/coins)

A GA SEI project in collaboration between Andrew Huang and Trong Nguyen, we set out to design an app to mimic CoinMarketCap in both feel and functionality. Essentially both a cryptocurrency tracker and portfolio tracker/management system.

Begin simply by adding things to your portfolio!
As it stands, login is currently a WIP but once up and running, you will be redirected to register when attempting to Fav. Regardless, the main features of being able to view the currencies and it's details are free for use (pending API limitations.)
